    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a Cajun style baked chicken and noodles dish. It's a flavorful mix of blackened chicken with rice,
        noodles, and vegetable made casserole style in a cast-iron skillet.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless chicken breasts or thighs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>kosher salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1 lemon, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry broken spaghetti or angel hair pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup long grain rice</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers, sliced</li>
        <li>3-4 cups low sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh tenders herbs, cilantro + parsley</li>
        <li>chili flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425Â° F.</li>
        <li>In a large oven-safe skillet, combine the olive oil, chicken, and cajun seasoning, toss to coat. Set the</li>
        skillet over high heat. Sear on both sides until golden, 3-5 minutes. During the last 2 minutes of cooking, add
        1 tablespoon of butter and lemon slices. Remove everything from the skillet.
        <li>Add the rice and pasta. Cook until the rice is toasted, about 1 minute. Add the onion and peppers and</li>
        continue to cook another 3-4 minutes, then pour in 3 cups broth. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil.
        <li>Slide the chicken, lemon slices, and any juices left on the plate back into the skillet. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet and turn the heat down to the lowest setting possible. Allow the rice to cook 10 minutes,</li>
        until most of the liquid has cooked into the rice, but not all of it. If needed add more broth. Bake, uncovered
        for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
        <li>Meanwhile, melt together 5 tablespoons butter, the garlic, and a pinch of chili flakes. Cook until the butter</li>
        is browning. Stir in the mixed herbs.
        <li>Serve the chicken and rice drizzled with garlic butter and topped with fresh herbs.</li>
